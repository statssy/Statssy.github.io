20.09.27 summary

```
It is profound honor to address the United Nations General Assenmbly.  
75 years after the end of World War 2  
and the founding of the United Nations, we are once again engaged in a great global struggle.  
We have waged a fierce battle against the invisible enemy, the China virus-which has claimed countless lives in 188 countries.  
In the United States, we launched the most aggressive mobilization since the Second World War.  
We rapidly produced a record supply of ventilators,  
creating a surplus that allowed us to share them with friends and partners all around the globe.
