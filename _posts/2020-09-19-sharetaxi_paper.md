# Dynamic Shared-Taxi Dispatch Algorithm with Hybrid Simulated Annealing


## 0. ABSTRACT

### 0-1 Problem

- Taxi-Dispatching-Systems offer better services in terms of shorter wait time and passenger travel convenience.

- However, a shortage of taxicabs has always been critical in many urban contexts especially during peak hour

- Taxi has great petential to maximize its efficency by employing the shared-ride concept

- Ride-Sharing projects ar e expected to bring substantial benefits arising from energy consumption and operation efficiency

- Develop advenced algorithms and investigate the collective benefits by maximizing occupancy and minimizeing travel times in real-time


### 0-2 Purpose

- This Paper investigates how taxi services can be imporved by proposing algorithms

- How taxi sevices can be imporoved by proposing shared-taxi algorithms 

- What type of objective functions and constraints could be employed to prevent excessive passenger detours

- Hybrid Simulated Annealing(HSA) is applied to dynamically assign passenger requests efficiently

- A series of simulations are conducted with two different taxi operation strategies


### 0-3 Result

- Reveal that allowing ride-sharing for taxicabs increases productivity over the various demand levels 

- HSA can be considered as a suitable solution to maximize the system
